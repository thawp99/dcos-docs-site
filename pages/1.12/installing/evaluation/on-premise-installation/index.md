You can install a DC/OS cluster on premises using the following methods:

1. [DC/OS installation with Ansible On-Premises](https://github.com/dcos-labs/ansible-dcos/blob/master/docs/INSTALL_ONPREM.md).
2. [DC/OS installation with Chef On-Premises](https://github.com/dcos-labs/dcos-chef).
3. [DC/OS installation with Puppet On-Premises](https://github.com/dcos-labs/dcos-puppet).

 **Note:** The recommended way to install production-ready DC/OS that can be upgraded in place is to use the [production installation](/1.11/installing/production/deploying-dcos/installation/) method.
